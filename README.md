WIREFRAME//
https://wireframe.cc/9lTac4

	Looking back at these original ideas I can see how my project morphed into something more realistic to what I thought I could accomplish and had a more simplistic and clear purpose. I also researched the links provided and found NASA open API's and decided to make it my project to view the photography. I also appreciate that these designs look nothing like the finished product as I decided after a lecture during project week on mobile first philosophy, to stop attempting CSS grid and approach the solution with Flexbox. I appreciate the flick and scroll ability without having to media query and still be centered and responsive across all displays. 


TECHNOLOGIES USED//

Javascript, HTML, CSS, Flexbox, fetch API's, callback functions, arrow functions'
	I am injecting code into the HTML through the use of Javascript with the response JSON object utilized 
	by the json() & setAttribute() methods.

HURTLES AND  OBSTACLES //
	I was able to get all my MVP goals accomplished for this project and worked through several very confusing hurtles / obstacles with the basic structuring of Javascript and with CSS. Ultimately, I found victory through research and help from my classmates!
